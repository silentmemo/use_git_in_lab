### Introduction
Working on a research project may span over years, e.g. PhD projects 3-4 years. Keeping track of changes of project probably the most laborious task. To keep track of rationale and associated with the different edits to the documents will be near impossible. To facilitate the proper documentation of records, which is directly related to reproducibility of the work. Also, projects may take efforts from several individuals, using git and github helps everyone to get involved on the same project. Lastly, I think it is cool to be able to put down the url to a code repository of your work in the “Code availability” section, instead of just a vague statement.

### What is git?

Git is a version control system. Version control means to manage and track changes to a project. It's a blend of the project itself together with the changelog. A common pattern in every project is that we focus on the final product itself, but ignored the project development progress which entails the rationale of the decisions that shapes each and every part of the project.  

Git is a distributed version control system, you can work on the same project on different machines, and all edits to the same repository can be combined.  This feature is beneficial for both working solo or in collaboration. Sometimes, you may need to computational resources on a HPC to work on some task, you can track changes on that if you use git. In other instance, say you are on vacation, and you want to stay completely offline while working on your project. You can do that with git. You can choose when to integrate your edits.  

Git is a popular version control system. If you search a random bioinformatics article in any journal, chances are you will find a github repository.
